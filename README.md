# Dodge-The-Creeps

Very first Godot Engine game

## Game

"Dodge The Creeps!" is a simple game where ennemies will spawn randomly around the screen and the player has to survive by moving as long as possible

## Godot Engine

The Godot Engine has been used to complete this project.
The game is also a game created by Godot as a tutorial. This is the result of my work.
Tutorial can be found here [https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html]

## Gameplay

User can move using:
  - WASD for US keyboard layouts
  - ZQSD for FR keyboard layouts
  - Arrows

Space bar can be used to start a new game

## Playable version

Builded versions can be found in:
  - 'build-linux' for Linux users
  - 'build-macos' for MacOS users
  - 'build-w10' for Windows 10 users

They all contain a 'Dodge The Creeps.zip' file, itself containing the playable game.
